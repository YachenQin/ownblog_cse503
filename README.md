#Creative Portion:#

1. Design CSS to make the login and upload interface much more beautiful and comfortable. 

2. We add give flower button for each article allow users to show their attitude with different articles. The guest can see the number of flowers but they can't give flowers out. And if you are an author, once you login, we will show you on the main page about the number of flowers you received.
